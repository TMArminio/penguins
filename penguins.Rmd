## Single trait distribution
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)
```

## Relationship between multiple traits
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
  
## Sexual dimorphism
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, color=sex)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
